<p>What happens to an instance of an Android Fragment, when does it happen and why?</p>
<p>When using ViewPager and FragmentAdapter, the important details hidden and it is easy to make a complete mess.</p>
<p>The documentation on Android fragments isn't as comprehensive as I would like.
I read all of the documentation for
<code>ViewPager</code>,
<code>PagerAdapter</code>,
<code>FragmentPagerAdapter</code>
and
<code>Fragment Manager</code>
but the workings remained somewhat mysterious.</p>
<p>In this article I will enlighten you as to what is going on.</p>
<p>It may be helpful to create a new project in Android Studio, with a tabbed activity with a ViewPager navigation style.
That is the default template that this article is based on. Or download my <a href="https://github.com/t3hmun/OnTheNatureOfFragmentsAndTheActivityLifeCycle">demo app from github</a>.</p>
<h2>The All Important FragmentManager</h2>
<p>Fragments are managed by the FragmentManager.
It is possible to use fragments without it, but proper use of FragmentManager is usually recommended for efficiency.
The FragmentManager manages the life-cycle of the fragment in coordination with the activity lifecycle.
It does some clever things for efficiency, but the machinations are somewhat perilous to the uninitiated.</p>
<p>When a fragment is inserted directly into a xml layout the FragmentManager is automatically used in the background.
FragmentPagerAdapter also does all the essential FragmentManager work in its implementation.</p>
<p>With a default ViewPager activity the FragmentManager is hidden away in the FragmentPagerAdapter implementation,
but it is essential to know it is there managing the creation and destruction of Fragments.</p>
<h2>ViewPager</h2>
<p>The ViewPager manages the animation and page swiping interaction.</p>
<p>It is rather un-interesting unless you want to do some custom animation,
in which case go read about ViewPager.PageTransformer.</p>
<h2>The Adapter and the Fragments</h2>
<p>The PagerAdapter has the task of supplying the ViewPager with the views to display in each page.
The ViewPager asks the adapter to create and destroy views as it needs them.</p>
<p>The FragmentPagerAdapter is an implementation of PagerAdapter using Fragments for each page.
Inside FragmentPagerAdapter the FragmentManager is used to cache and manage the page Fragments efficiently.</p>
<p>Have a quick read of the <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/nougat-release/v13/java/android/support/v13/app/FragmentPagerAdapter.java">FragmentPagerAdapter source code</a>.
It is short and simple.</p>
<h3>Fragment Creation</h3>
<p>When the app starts the ViewPager will ask the adapter for up to three pages, the current next and previous pages.
This is required so that the both views can be seen when swiping between 2 views.</p>
<p>The first major source of confusion is the <code>FragmentPagerAdapter.getItem()</code> method.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every time the ViewPager asks for a view the adapter first asks the FragmentManager.</li>
<li>The FragmentAdapter only calls <code>getItem()</code> if the fragment is not found in the FragmentManager.</li>
<li>After calling <code>getItem()</code> the fragment is immediately added to the FragmentManager.</li>
</ul>
<p>So <code>getItem</code> is only used to initialise a fragment the first time that it is used.</p>
<h3>Fragment Destruction (Partial)</h3>
<p>When the page is no longer visible or adjacent to the visible page the ViewPager asks the adapter to destroy it.
However the FragmentPagerAdapter doesn't destroy the fragment entirely.
It calls <code>FragmentTransaction.detach(fragment)</code>, which destroys the fragment's entire view hierarchy, but not the object.
Next time the ViewPager wants that page the same fragment object can be retrieved and the view is rebuilt.
In the process the <code>onCreateView()</code> is called again, this is where your logic to initialise the view belongs.</p>
<p>This is the same as process for the back-stack show in the <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html#Creating">Fragments documentation flow chart</a>.</p>
<p><strong>However it is not that simple.</strong> Sometimes the object is destroyed <em>almost</em> completely...</p>
<h3>The Screen Rotation Gotcha</h3>
<p>When the screen rotates the activity is destroyed and you might be forgiven for thinking everything starts again
(if this doesn't ring a bell go read the <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes.html">configuration change docs</a> and study the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#ActivityLifecycle">life-cycle chart</a>).</p>
<p>Sure, it goes through the process of making a new ViewPager and and new FragmentAdapter.
However the <strong>FragmentManager does not forget</strong>.</p>
<p>Any fragments previously added to the FragmentManager are not fully lost, their arguments are saved
(this is referring to a bundle set and accessed via <code>Fragment.setArguments()</code> and <code>getArguments</code> methods).
When you ask for one of those fragments the FragmentManager creates a new instance of the fragment with the default empty constructor and sets the arguments.</p>
<p>This means the freshly created FragmentAdapter may never call <code>getView()</code>, it gets newly created fragments from the FragmentManager instead.
Any initialisation logic you put in <code>getView()</code> does not happen again.
This fresh fragment object entirely relies on what was saved using <code>Fragment.setArguments()</code> to initialise it.</p>
<p>For reliable code the initialisation done via <code>getView()</code> should only call <code>setArguments()</code>,
with the actual initialisation being done in <code>onCreateView()</code> using <code>getArguments()</code>.</p>
<h2>What we've Learnt About ViewPager Fragments</h2>
<ul>
<li>Up to three views may be initialised simultaneously with their <code>onCreateView()</code> methods being called.
<ul>
<li>Multiple non-visible page might be initialised and fully created at any time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The page fragment may be initialised as a new object multiple times:
<ul>
<li>Initialised via your own code via FragmentManager.getItem(). Happens only once.</li>
<li>Initialised using the default empty constructor of the fragment by the FragmentManager
<ul>
<li>Happens on screen rotation</li>
<li>Happens if the system is desperate for memory</li>
<li>The FragmentManager will restore the fragment's arguments (accessed via <code>Fragment.getArguments()</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This means any fields set in <code>getItem()</code> might be lost. Only arguments can be trusted to persist.</li>
<li>Must be able to fully initialise the Fragment from empty ctor and arguments (usually done in <code>onCreateView()</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>onCreateView()</code> may be called many times on the same object:
<ul>
<li>Happens when the pager navigates to the page or an adjacent page.</li>
<li>Some of the initialisation might not need to be repeated if the fragment object is being re-used
<ul>
<li>For large tasks involving fields, check if the field is already initialised.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This may seem a bit complicated, but this is really an investigation into everything that can go wrong.
For a simple page fragment:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <code>FragmentAdapter.getItem()</code> use <code>Fragment.setArguments()</code> to save all info required to configure the view.</li>
<li>Load the data and configure the view using <code>getArguments()</code> in the fragment's <code>onCreateView()</code> method.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is enough to make a simple page fragment work reliably.</p>
<p>On more complicated applications one may want to make use of <code>onAttach()</code> and <code>onCreate()</code>, but for a small app keep it simple.</p>
<h2>Im Confused I Need a Demonstration</h2>
<p>You are in luck.</p>
<p>https://github.com/t3hmun/OnTheNatureOfFragmentsAndTheActivityLifeCycle</p>
<p>It is a basic modification of the default <code>Tabbed-Activity</code> - <code>SwipeViews</code> template with a lot of logging.</p>
<p>Run it in Android studio, watch the log messages show you exactly what part of the activity and fragment lifecycle is happening when you swipe views and rotate.</p>
