WhatsApp won't upload WebM video clips so they must be converted before sharing.

Start by downloading [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).
No need to install anything just extract it somewhere convenient.

Open a console in the FFmpeg bin directory:

`./ffmpeg -i avideo.webm avideo.mp4`

The `-i` option means input and the argument at the end is the output file.

There are probably a lot of settings that could be tweaked but the defaults work.
