## Introduction

I wrote a static site generator script to create this website. 
I decided to write the whole thing from scratch instead of using existing projects in order to learn a bit of JS.
Also writing things myself allowed me to customise things my own way:

* No annoying dependencies
    * Installing more than one of Ruby, Python and NodeJs is horrible.
    * I chose Node.Js so that I could practice some JavaScript
* Site shouldn't have any extraneous hard to understand JS.
    * This means no jQuery or any other lib bigger than my site's content.
    * Also no convoluted responsive themes.
* Should be comfortable to read on both small phones and large monitors.
    * No unpredictable scripted resizing that some responsive themes are guilty of.
    * Limited reading width that reflows to smaller screens/windows (aka word wrap).
* The HTML should validate and be impaired-reader friendly.
* Full syntax highlighting for code
    * I'm a software developer, I'll be writing about code.

The frameworks/libs I've used:

* [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) is used to template all pages and the content of unique pages.
* [Less](lesscss.org) is used to create the CSS.
* Markdown is used for authoring posts to the web-log 
  (using [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) 
  with [highlight.Js](highlightjs.org)).
* Node.Js 6 is used to tie everything together and generate the site in one command.

## Structure

* Code
    * `pub.js`: This is the main publishing code and entry point.
    * `md.js`: A wrapper for a markdown library.
    * `effess.js`: A promise based wrapper for common file IO functions used by `pub.js`.
* Style
    * `templates/`: Pug templates used by pages and posts
        * The `universal.pug` template should be used by every page of the site.
        * The `post.pug` template wraps the html generated from the Markdown posts.
    * `css/`: CSS and LESS files, compiled by the `main.less` file. 
    The intent is to output a single `main.css` file.
* Content
    * `pages/`: Contains unique pages of the website written using Pug.
    * `posts/`: Markdown files that represent posts to the web-log.

## Configuration

The basic site configuration should be tweaked for your site.
It can be found in the `site` constant inside the `configure()` function at the beginning of `pub
.js`.
 
`site.baseUrl` is used to generate canonical urls for all pages.

`site.nav` is a list of pages that should be part of the main nav that appears on all pages.

## Site Output Folder

The site output is folder is configured via the `outputDir` variable in `configure()` in `pub.js`.

For my site that folder is configured as a git submodule that points to the master branch of my Github pages repo.
The `master` branch only contains the site that is shown via Github pages, 
the `source` branch contains all this site generation code and unprocessed site data.

> Configuring the output folder as a Git submodule is a convenience hack.
It allows allows everything to be kept in a single repository while separating the output and development.
If you don't like this hack put the code and site data in a different repo.


## Writing Posts

To avoid duplicating information the post date and title is read directly from the filename.
As a result the file title must follow the standard pattern.

```
year-month-day_The Main Title Of the Post.md
For example:
2016-11-15_Web-Log Generator Usage.md
```

Any spaces in the title are converted to dashes for the url of the post, 
however dashes in the title are preserved for the title in the document.

Front-matter in the document is optional, the essential information is all in the filename.
In order to add a description for the metadata and index entry for the post insert a Json block to the start 
of the document. It must begin on the first line of the document.

```json
{ 
    "description": "A quick run-down of the structure and usage of the code I wrote for generating this web-log." 
}
```

Json was chosen because it is easy to use and doesn't usually confuse markdown parsers.

Do not repeat the title in the document, it will be inserted automatically as a `h1` at the beginning.
Also do no use `h1` (a single `#` heading) in the document because this should only be used for the main title.

## Generating the Site

The `test` and `debug` flags are optional, may be a good idea on first try.

Test mode outputs the site to `test/` with resolved file urls so that links work when the files are opened without a 
server.
This is the quickest way of testing the output.

The debug flag spams some extra information, may be a bit of a mess.

```bash
$ node pub test debug
```

Run `pub.js` without the test flag to get proper site output with correct relative urls.
This output can then be published to a Github pages repo master branch or any other server.


## Errors

The code is meant to be fail-fast, will abort on any error, via the `errorAndExit()` function.
It prints the error to the console and then kills the process.
Explicitly killing the process is necessary because the code is very asynchronous.
As a result there may be partial output after an error.
